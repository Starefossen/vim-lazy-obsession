vim-lazy-obsession
==================

This plugin extends (vim-obsession)[https://github.com/tpope/vim-obsession] so
that sessions are automatically created and loaded whenever Vim is ran without
any command arguments. They are all stored into the location represented by the
`g:sessions_directory` variable, which defaults to `$HOME/.vim/sessions`.
